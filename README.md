# Budget-Tracker

This work builds onto an existing Budget Tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality. The user can add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without a connection. When transactions are entered offline they are stored and and added to the database when brought back online.

Offline functionality is implemented utilizing a Webpack Manifest, Service Worker, and IndexedDB.

## User Story

```
AS AN avid traveller
I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection
WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit
THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
```
